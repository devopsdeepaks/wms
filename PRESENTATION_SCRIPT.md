## üìû Q&A Preparation

### Common Technical Questions

**Q: "How does the system handle data consistency?"**
A: "I implemented transaction-based updates with SQLAlchemy ORM, ensuring ACID compliance. The system uses database constraints and validation layers to maintain data integrity across all operations."

**Q: "What about security considerations?"**  
A: "Current version focuses on functionality, but the Flask framework provides built-in security features. For production, I would add authentication, input sanitization, CSRF protection, and API rate limiting."

**Q: "How would you scale this for enterprise use?"**
A: "The modular architecture supports horizontal scaling. I would implement microservices, add Redis caching, use PostgreSQL clustering, and deploy with Docker/Kubernetes for enterprise scalability."

**Q: "How do you ensure code quality?"**
A: "I follow PEP 8 standards, implement comprehensive error handling, use type hints where appropriate, and maintain clear separation of concerns. The health check script ensures system reliability."
